This super-speed card works great in my phone. I haven't had any problems with it since I bought the thing! I'm certainly able to record HD video right onto the card no problem. I recommend this for those who need quick data delivery to and from there external card. I recommend it!,5,Pozitif
"I purchased this product knowing there might be an issue with the galaxy s4. This card worked for a week or two then began to spontaneously unmount and would mount itself back in. The unmount periods began to become longer than a few hours, days! I tried this card in a galaxy note 2 still with the same result. I attempted to contact Sandisk customer service and utilize the warranty. They know of the problem and began the exchange process then instructed me to wait for a mailing label that never came. I called back and was told that they would re-email it to me. To this day I am still waiting for that email. I have never had this issue with this company but with  ever changing technology, it is what it is, right? I know this card will be good for some device I have. If you own a galaxy phone beware!! I have not attempted to use this in a samsung tablet so on that I cannot review.",1,Negatif
"Bought this to use with my Samsung HMX W300. Works well, good transfer speeds and comes with a normal size SD card to transfer if needed.",5,Pozitif
"This was an inexpensive way to get my Galaxy Note II from 16GB to 32GB of memory. Its plenty fast and can hold lots of photos, music, etc.",5,Pozitif
Purchased two 32 GBcards  for the two new Samsung S4s in or family.  After using for several weeks no issues at all saving a variety of files - photos and Office documents.,4,Pozitif
"Bought this for my S3 and loaded it with 4 seasons of Futurama, 5 full length HD movies, several documentaries, and a dozen or so 30 minute comedy shows with plenty of room left over for pictures, etc...Only slight nitpick is when booting up into recovery mode on the S3 it will not recognize the card. Wanted to update the phone to the latest version of Android and it would not see it. Had to resort to a 2GB MicroSD I had laying around. That wasn't a SD card issue but I thought I would throw that in.",5,Pozitif
good scan disk but the wrong one for my camera I needed a class 6 this class 10 locks up for no reason and even will lock up my computer when it does..,4,Negatif
"Just received this today. Removed it from the packaging and inserted it into my Samsung Galaxy S3 (Verizon) and powered the unit back up and the storage was available. No formatting required. Worked the first time out. Settings showed 29.71GB of total space (32GB version) and 29.71GB of free space. I like the fact that a SD adapter came with it. Should I ever need to insert the card into my laptop it will come in handy. (yes I can plug my phone directly to my laptop but if I ever swap this 32GB card out of my phone and replace it with a 64GB version, I can use this 32GB version via the adapter for other purposes.)",5,Pozitif
What more can I say?I'm using it to double the memory of my Asus TF700 (from 32 to 64Gb) and this card has a good read/write performance and it's SanDisk!Recommended.,5,Pozitif
"Works as advertised, no issues to date.  There are faster cards out there but you will pay more for them.",5,Pozitif
...and they're right!This microSDHC card is fast. I started formatting it a little behind another class 10 card (not a UHS-1) card and it formatted all 32GB ahead of the Transcend 16GB card - which is no slouch either! It's the fastest flash card I've sent yet. I doubt you will be disappointed unless you're an alien with more advanced technology.,5,Pozitif
"Once I figured out the S3 wasn't liking the exfat file structure and formatted to fat32 it works quite well. I don't know if it's the phone or card and I'm not about to test it elsewhere, but I didn't see the 30MB/s speeds. It works good enough for the phone and it's the best option I have for the biggest storage for now.1080P videos with no issues. No problems with read/write stability. Overall I'm happy I bought it.",4,Pozitif
Works fine in a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 - no need to format (although I did) - recognized as soon as it was popped in 59.47GB usable.Arrived really fast and nicely packaged.  I would order again.,5,Pozitif
"This card is pretty cheap for how tiny (physically) and large (digitally) it is - at least in mid 2014. I got it to extend the storage capacity of my Surface Pro 3, and it has done just that. I can store files on it so that I don't have to take up precious space that can be dedicated towards programs since the Surface Pro 3 has a full Windows 8 on it. It also doubles as a storage device for my GoPro Hero 3 Black, but I have a faster card for it to prevent the freezing issue. The size of this micro SD card just does a great job in storing data like videos, photos, and music. It fits in most devices that are moving to Micro SDXC, such as phones, tablets, and my beloved Surface Pro 3. I highly recommend this card if you just need to extend the storage of your device. Reconsider a faster card if you want to record video straight to it, like with a GoPro.",5,Pozitif
It's a good capacity but the speed is slow that is almost 10M...but it's acceptable to me. I like it.,4,Pozitif
"I bought this to use as expanded storage in my Asus Transformer Book T100 but it was unstable and I have had to return it. Although the tablet would see the card when it was first inserted there would be errors trying to copy files onto it and then Windows would indicate that it needed formatting. If I tried a quick format then everything seemed to be OK but the instability would return as soon as I tried to copy data to the card. If I tried a full format it always failed.I gave it two starts because it seemed to work using the supplied SD adapter in a Windows 7 laptop. I was able to do a full format on that but, when I put it back into the tablet, the problems continued. The tablet is compatible with SDXC cards and, when I tried a different micro SD card in the tablet, it worked fine so I assume it was a problem with this card.",2,Negatif
"I've used many others, and this is average. Its in my son's android, and I don't really think the application its in right now is a the best way to determine its speed / performance.  Otherwise it does what i want it to.The adapter will come in handy later.",4,Pozitif
"I bought the SanDisk 32 Gb micro SD card (class 10) in Dec for a new Galaxy S3. I used it for songs and video and pics. It started acting flaky in April and would unmount itself and then remount and I had problems with playing music. Then it completely died and would not even reformat. This is a known issue, and I will write back after I try to get SanDisk to replace it.",1,Negatif
64 gb of fast microSD storage at a great price.  What's not to love?  Works perfectly with my 64gb Dell Venue Pro 8.,5,Pozitif
"I bought this the day it came out for the great price of $119.99 and it finally showed up a month later. (I knew this going in). I put it in my Galaxy note 3 and it instantly recognized it and I was set.Speeds in my laptop via the included adapter ranged from 15-30mb read speed and about 12mb write speed. I copied an entire 64 GB card over to this one, and it took some time, but now I have double the space.",5,Pozitif
"Got this to use with my GoPro, give 2 hours of recording time, once II figured out how to use the camera.",5,Pozitif
"no problems works well does what it is supposed to do, store files.  Pretty quick read and write speed as well",5,Pozitif
"Good amount of space for the stuff I want to do, and fits in my GoPro. What more can I say?",5,Pozitif
I bought the Sandisk Ultra 32gb card for use in my Samsung smart phone.  Worked great for about 3 months.  Now the phone won't recognize the card & neither will my computer.  Just went unreadable one day.  Very disappointed in the reliability of this card.  Will contact Sandisk as it has a lifetime warranty.  Shall see if they'll stand behind their product.,1,Negatif
Received my card in a decent amount of time and it was packaged well . The memory card was crispy brand new and in perfect condition . After installing the card in my video camera it worked perfectly! Very good deal.,5,Pozitif
"I own a first generation Microsoft Surface Pro 128, and it has been a good machine but I was really finding it challenging working within the constraint of 128GB of storage space. I had a 64GB Class 10 SDXC card, which worked well but was not going to fit the VMWare virtual machine I wanted to run off the SD storage. The Virtual Machine increases in size with regular use, and the operating system I was running is recommended for at least 40GB of max storage to operate properly.  Combined with the files I needed to store, and 64GB memory chip was no longer sufficient.The SanDisk Ultra 128GB MicroSDXC Class 10 Memory Card was able to handle that with ease, however I have found that the virtual machine ran noticeably faster off the 64GB chip than this one. I've actually ordered a second of these to see if I might have just received a flawed chip. If the replacement chip offers improvement I will revise this review. It provides its main selling point, more storage at a relatively low cost, so far has run reliably in my tablet computer.If storage space is a significant issue for your device and the memory can make use of 128GB SDXC, then I would recommend product.",4,Pozitif
"I love the 64GB capacity, and it is compatible with my devices.  I have one in Go Pro Hero3 and one in a Samsung Galaxy 7&#34; tablet.",5,Pozitif
"the first 2 I bought both had multiple problems with not being recognized, this one so far has had no problems.",4,Pozitif
"memory cards best in world. The memory card completely corresponds to the description. I am happy, my smartphone is happy, my tablet is happy. amazon thanks",5,Pozitif
"Absolutely a perfect MicroSD Chip.4500 songs were transferred into it, effortlessly and I have  balance of about 50% of usable space.SanDisk is a synonym with all Engineers and I need not add any thing to glorify it.Thank you SanDisk thank you AMAZON.SincerelyKJ Kumar",5,Pozitif
I bought this for my 6yr old's Nabi tablet. Thing works perfectly allowing him to download music and games with ease. Loved the price and trust SanDisk products.,5,Pozitif
"Great speed, great capacity, great price, and fits great in my HTC Evo Design 4G Android phone. I recomend it.",5,Pozitif
"Great chip, bought it for use in my raspberry pi projects as linux hard drive.Very fast.Real deal.Price was excellent.Nice to get real chip, instead of cheap nock off, often sold as brand name card.",5,Pozitif
"This is my first SanDisk card, I have a bunch of other brands.  I use this one in a tablet.  It works great!  Really love the lifetime warranty that's included. So far so good!",5,Pozitif
Phone missing extra storage space? This was a great purchase and at a great price with Amazon. Would recommend for the movie watcher or photo/music enthusiast.,5,Pozitif
"I got several of these for my tablet.. So far I am very happy.. Actually I have one in my phone, one in my tablet, and one as a backup for traveling.. So far they have been great for me...",5,Pozitif
I use Sandisk exclusively for serious pro-sumer work including 4 hour concert videos. I've never had a problem in 3 years and wouldn't use anything else.,5,Pozitif
I got this to add some room on my Samsung Galaxy S3. It works great. I do not have any complaints.,5,Pozitif
"I have been pleased with the performance and price point for this card. No complaints, I would recommend it based on price & performance.",5,Pozitif
"64GB for this price is a nice deal, especially when you are trying to add storage capability for a tablet or phone.  Keep in mind that not all phones/tablets/devices support 64GB, so you may have to get the 32 GB instead.  Performance is very good, especially when weighing with price and capacity.",5,Pozitif
"It's a 32Gb micro card, it works well and haven't had any issues with it. Would recommend if you are considering.",5,Pozitif
This card is one of the fastest SD cards on the market. It works great for your Samsung Galaxy Note II. No issues with installation or device recognition. Highly recommended.,5,Pozitif
"I've wasted time and money trying other company's SD and MicroSD cards, some work all right, and some died on me, it's not the price that you pay but rather the value that you get. Let me tell ya, SanDisk makes the best memory cards, period..... I bought one of this card for my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 phone, mostly for movies and music. I usually use AnyDVD & Handbrake programs to convert movies (large MP4 also playable on my Samsung tablet) and simply copy-and-paste movies and musics on this little card. Both my phone and tablet read this card without any problem and I cannot imagine my phone without it. Now I've bought 2 more....",5,Pozitif
"I have had cheaper SD Cards in the past, but they almost always wound up letting me down. I made up my mind some time ago that I would stick with SanDisk and have been completely satisfied with all my cards from them ever since. This card sits in my wife's phone and is used to store all her music and pictures. It has been in & out close to a dozen times (because I like to fiddle with stuff) and as proven very durable.In case anyone wants to know, &#34;Class 10&#34; is the only way to go with these cards (until they come out with something faster), the read/write speed is well worth the few extra bucks for my needs.I also have a &#34;Class 10&#34; 64 GB in my Galaxy SIII and it's as good or better. I even got it wet (I mean soaked) and it is still working like a charm.I will definitely recommend this to anyone, and will be sticking with SanDisk for all my other devices.",5,Pozitif
it was already formatted and ready to go.  just plug it in and start recording - nothing more to say for a storage device - just want it to work with no hassles.,5,Pozitif
"A truly great value, not nearly as expensive as I thought it would be. Lots of memory and good speed as well.",5,Pozitif
I have purchased and used several SanDisk memory cards and I have never experienced any issues with those cards.  One of my first choices when I am in the market for a memory card,5,Pozitif
"I'm running a live Linux system off of this card right now, via a USB port.  Seems to have good read/write speeds and is durable.",5,Pozitif
Good quality memory card. Have used it with the GoPro Hero 3 and works flawlessly. Wished all electronics were this simple,5,Pozitif
Upgraded from the 32GB and very satisfied. Works great with my phone and large library of music. Def would reccomend.,5,Pozitif
"Good product, no problems. I have this installed in my Samsung Galexy III. works well even in super HD video.",5,Pozitif
fast and holds all my music and larger apps.,5,Pozitif
Worked fine in my Samsung S4 for one year.  Then it stopped allowing writing to the card.  Would not format even on a PC or with another device.  The data is still there but cannot be erased.,1,Negatif
The internal memory on my ASUS tablet is kinda slow.  I installed this bad boy into my tablet and install the OS onto it.  Now the tablet runs nice and fast!,5,Pozitif
Pluggesd in the MicroSd csrd and it worked perfectly!  SanDisk has a solid performer here.  I'd recommend this product to anyone neededing this level of storage and speed.,5,Pozitif
Got this to shoot in HD. It is working really well so far. It is handling HD recording and playback great.,5,Pozitif
This is a great price for such big storage and it's does a great job with my first smart phone.,5,Pozitif
"I love this storage unit. I would buy again definitely. Great for pix, videos, docs, or whatever you want to store. I have  it in my ME173x.",5,Pozitif
I bought this memory card for my Samsung Note 10.1. i amis really happy about it and i am recommending this product & am very pleased about it.,5,Pozitif
"I bought this for an Atrix HD. The specs say maximum 32Gb, but 64 works fine with a formatted capacity of around 58GB.I did a speed benchmark here (I don't know if Amazon strips links)[...]",5,Pozitif
"Got this for my girlfriend for the tablet I bought her, she love this as she can now put all the music and pictures on her tablet that she wants and doesn't have to worry about running out of space anymore.",5,Pozitif
"Perfect.  Took card put old 32gb card and transferred it over to it in the computer.  (while my Samsung galaxy s5 was off).  Then inserted it in my Samsung galaxy s5, powered up and it was like I had never took the 32gb card out.  Read ringtones, programs stored on external sd card, everything - no errors, no glitches.  Connected the phone to the computer via usb cable and (usb 3 slot) and in no time my 75gb of music was transferred to my phone and it all read and is working perfectly.  I could not be more pleased when a products works like it is supposed to.",5,Pozitif
Bought for my wifes Samsung Galaxy 3 Tab. Lots of storage for pictures and music. Good product at reasonable price.,5,Pozitif
"Massive memory boost to my Captivate Glide.Holds all my music, files, etc and i still have 20GB free! O_OTransfer speeds are great!Really worth the price!",5,Pozitif
Got this for the Dell Venue 8 Pro and it works perfectly. No complaints. Here are more words to complete my review.,5,Pozitif
"Seemed to work well at first.  Then, I noticed the phone started mounting/unmounting the card. When I tried to update some music files on the card, I think it has failed.  My computer can no longer see it in the phone when the two are connected.Okay - an update here. Since I posted the problem on Amazon I was contacted by Sandisk. I made one phone call, they took my information, e-mailed me a pre-paid UPS label, and I sent the card in. I couldn't believe it, but I think I had a new and improved card in about three days!  Yes, the first one lasted a little over twelve months, but the replacement was tendered no questions asked. Great service that can only be five stars.By the way, the replacement is working great!  I ordered a 64gb Sandisk microSDHC Card as well!",5,Pozitif
"It may be that the internal SD slot of the 2012 Mac Book Air is not too fast perhaps?  I am very disappointed that I can only achieve 4-9 MB/s of write/read speed.  Makes me remember speeds of 5 years ago.  Again, this may be the computer's fault, but I am not too happy...",3,Negatif
"Works in a HTC Rezound.  Was running short of space on a 64GB Sandisk so I ordered this when it came out, fast and no issues.",5,Pozitif
"Wanted a larger faster card for my razr maxx, running on CM11/Android 4.4.  For the price this card was the best option.  My phone had no problem using it in the default exfat partition.  Is much faster than my old card.  No problems with it.  Couldn't be happier.",5,Pozitif
"When purchasing a memory expansion for my electronic devices I typically purchase from SanDisk.  It is a trusted name and does what I need when I need to do it, like feeding the chickens or mowing the lawn, Sony and Ultra can't do that....",5,Pozitif
You do need to have  the right equipment to use as very few can access these.  Only newer and equipment that CLEARLY STATE can use these will work so be aware.,5,Notr
does what is was designed,5,Pozitif
The card worked great at first. I've never had a problem with Sandisk in the past but I bought this card for my Galaxy S3 back in October and it was dead by December. I'm sorely disappointed by this purchase. Maybe it's just a faulty card but my experience was terrible so this gets one star.,1,Negatif
Has a fast response time.Your going to need to buy one of these eventually since smart phones are advancing and so are the tablets coming out.Slided it write into my phone and worked like a charm on the first try.Pictures and apps load really fast with no lag time.Love it so much im going for the 64gb and always class 10 for me.1 less thing to worry about.,5,Pozitif
"So, I was looking for a card to put all of my music on for those occasions when I have my phone but don't have my HD Zune -- which by the way is the BEST music player EVER and it's just a low-down shame they don't make them any more -- and this card holds all my tunes with about 4GB to spare. Excellent speed for music playback, excellent capacity.  Would be nice to get it in 128GB, but the price of those is simply not reasonable.",5,Pozitif
Great deal for a great product. Recommended for anyone needing to expand the memory of their portable devices. Comes with SD adapter for use in card readers.,5,Pozitif
"I got this for my Samsung Galaxy Note. After reading various reviews and comparing different micro SD cards, I decided to get this. One of the main reason was because of the speed of this card (UHS-1). The card has been good to me and I'm happy with my purchase.",5,Pozitif
"Good price, works flawless in my Samsung S4! Normal SanDisk quality! That is why I go with this brand and only this brand..",5,Pozitif
"SanDisk is one of the top brands for removable memory. As expected, this worked right out of the package. I use it with my GPS.",5,Pozitif
"I bought this with the sole intention of putting it in my Samsung Galaxy S3. I had to use a tool to format the card to FAT32, but once I did so, the card worked great. I have been taking advantage of the extra room I have for music, videos, pictures, etc. The SD adapter that comes with this is also handy.The transfer speeds didn't feel like class 10 when connected and transferred files from my computer, but my computer is 5 years old, so it's very possible that it's the problem. Other than that, I'm completely satisfied.",5,Pozitif
"I like it comes in handy fits good with my Galaxy S5 smartphone, no problem with filing data on a computer.",3,Pozitif
"It does what it says it will do - unlike most people I know.It also handles very cold temperatures well, too.",3,Pozitif
"Its just amazing the amount of storage you can get in the size of a pinky nail.  I have this mounted to my phone filled with music, documents, pictures and all of my mobile phone records and messages from the past 3 phones.  Still have plenty of room left and no issues.",4,Pozitif
"Works as described, good packaging, fair price, and i have no issues with the product up to this point.  thanks.",5,Pozitif
Great little card. I have had issues with my phone chewing them up and spitting them out pretty frequently this card seems to have solved that issue for me.,5,Pozitif
"The chip worked fine, fit perfectly, but it is SO TINY, if it falls out you are going to have a hard time finding it.If your application is a Tablet, or pad, if it has a &#34;push-in&#34; holder...you will want to put some tape, or other securing agent across the top of the chip and onto the Table sides.  If I had thought of it, clear finger nail polish would have worked just fine, or even a half drop of super glue on the top.I didn't, and it's forever gone now.  I changed from Android to Ipad and very satisfied that I upgraded to Apple.",3,Negatif
"Got this for my galaxy s3, fits well works fine. I moved all my stuff from the phone to the card and working great!",5,Pozitif
"I bought this to use on my tablet (an Asus Transformer TF101) to backup some of my data before I flashed a custom ROM. Works as expected out of the box; no formatting or fiddling needed. It comes with an SD card adapter and a little plastic case for it and the adapter. Android and the recovery kernels I've used have no trouble detecting whatever the default filesystem is on it.The one thing I would note: if you have an older SD card reader on your computer, it may not be able to read HC or XC micro SD cards. You may want to check if your read supports them.I recommend this to anyone who needs a SD or micro SD card for any purpose. It's cheap, tiny, and has massive storage capacity for it's size, so long as your device supports it.",5,Pozitif
This mem card is fast and does exactly what is supposed to do...save pictures quickly and have plenty of room for more.,5,Pozitif
Bought for my phone and its worked perfectly for quite a while now. Great size and great price. Cant go wrong with this.,5,Pozitif

Yeah baby. Love getting this amount of memory for so cheap. I'm not a pro but for everyday use it's a great deal.,5,Pozitif
"This is the fastest MicroSDHC I've used.  I got it for a tablet but it turned out the tablet had no MicroSDHC slot when it arrived.  So, using it for a 10.1MP camera.  It writes very quickly and then off to the next shot.  I'm quite pleased with the performance of this card.I think there may be cards even faster.  But this suits my needs of casual photography.",5,Pozitif

"I just don't get what has happened to SanDisk quality.  It seems to have gone down over the years.  This product was glitchy from day one.  I thought it would be fine after a quick check disk, but then it only got worse.  After less than a week I have to return it.  What upsets me is that this is not my first bad experience with SanDisk products.  I used to buy them all the time, they were my brand of choice for flash memory (cards or thumb drives).  The last three products I have bought from them have had problems and failed either immediately or shortly after usage.  So I give up.  I will start looking to other companies for my memory needs.  I bought a Transcend to replace this.  I hope it works out better.",1,Negatif
"I have nothing bad to say about this product. the packaging indicated that it was new, never tampered with. it came in the mail on time and I have had no issues with the card overheating like some other reviews have mentioned. I like that fact that now I have 16GB of space and this means I can have more pictures and home movies on my phone to share. Also music for when I'm working out. Great buy and for the price I really like it. I recommend it and will be buying one more for another phone.",4,Pozitif
"The description on the Amazon page calls this a class 10 card with UHS-1 performance.  And while technically correct, (Full HD 1080p recording). You would expect more performance in the Sequential Write speeds.  It actually doesn't even hit the class 10 speed unless you round up (9.951 MB/s).  I have 2 of these cards and they both report the same speed.  My Kingston 8GB SDHC Class 4 writes at 11.854 MB/s.  Now keep in mind the Sandisk beats the other cards in the random reads and writes.  So maybe the design for those faster random reads and writes causes the sequential writes to run slower than expected.

"Product: SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQU-064G-AFFP-ARating: 5/5 (Excellent)People buy MicroSD cards with 4 primary criteria in mind: (1) Storage Capacity, (2) Price, (3) Reliability/Compatibility/Availability, and (4) Speed.  When I bought the u64 back in Feb 2013 (not long after its release) it was the largest and fastest MicroSD available at the time, and it weighed in at a good price and backed up by SanDisk reputation.For me, and my Galaxy S3 {SCH-i535, currently with Android 4.3} this card has been a delightful slam dunk on all four counts.  I was reminded of this today when I slammed 30+gb of MP3's from my PC onto my S3's card.

Very happy being able to start moving my music from the ever so aging iTunes to the card. The read and write speeds are more than acceptable, much faster than any of the other microsd cards that I have. I'm a very technical user, but would have felt very comfortable with talking my mother through such an easy procedure.

"I am primarily using this to supplement storage on my Microsoft Surface Pro and have a small library of movies and TV shows to carry around while I'm on the go. A lot of ultrabooks and the like come with just 128gb of storage and I think this SD card is a great way to store some media while you save room on the hard-drive for your program installations etc. The speeds I'm seeing are consistently around the peak that the card is rated for, and work great for playback of my lossless MKV movie files recorded at a high blu-ray quality bitrate. I've also tried it with my Android smartphone and I'm seeing similarly high peak-performance speeds for file transfer and smooth playback of media. It comes with an adapter to convert it to the standard SD card size in use with devices like SLR cameras etc. so you'll be covered under almost any circumstance. I only wish I could buy a larger capacity model, but as it stands I think with the Amazon sale prices that regularly come for this product it's a great deal.",5,Pozitif

"People often ask me about bargain-basement pricing on no-name brands of media, and you know I just have to cite my own experiences with cheap media, and it's just that, cheap media, prone to failure or worse if it's a complex format as this one is, the SDXC format. They have crammed a TON of memory modules in that little bujgger, you know? I say go with experience, go with a leader in the field, so there's pretty much SanDisk at the top of the heap, and the rest trail far, far behind in volume and precision assembly techniques...so I vote for SanDisk every time, and unless my experience is changed  by some anomaly I'll keep on recommending SanDisk above all others.It's rated at 40MB/sec write speed, which is enough to keep up with even the fastest real camera or phone camera out there in the wild, and it certainly keeps up with my Samsung Note 3's 13-mega-pixel rocket camera, one that shoots up to 8fps in burst mode taking certain shots, so if it works for that camera perfect, chances are it will work for your setup great also!Buying the SanDisk memory module costs what, $5-$7 more than the others max, right?

"I ordered these cards at a great price during black friday week/weekend.  I began loading some files (music, videos, pics, etc).  The first card worked without any problems.  The second card started giving me cyclic redundancy errors.  At first, I thought it was my hard drive that was failing, and tried to copy the same files to a flash drive which worked just fine.  Ok, maybe I received a dud, and tried with another card from my purchase.  Same results, cyclic redundancy error.  I started searching online, and found a utility via one of the reviews on Amazon called H2testw.  Ran the test on both cards, and it reported errors.  It also reported write speed of only 4MB/sec, which is way below advertised speeds.  These items were in retail packaging, and I remember reading about the bulk package items being fakes.  I guess the retail package cards aren't any better.I should have waited to do the refund because now I have to process the refund seperately.  I will test another card to see if I have better luck.  I wanted to leave a 1 star, but I gave 2 stars since 1 card worked so far.  I have 2 more to test.Very dissapointed because I was a fan of the Sandisk Ultra series for being reliable, but I guess they are cheaping out on quality to increase their profit.  I would have been extremely upset if I used these cards for anything important.",2,Negatif

This was an exceptional deal...especially since they actually sent me a 64GB card instead of a 32GB.  Price is right. ;-),5,Pozitif
I got an amazing price and this is an amazing product. 64 gigs is a lot of memory. I don't think I'm ever going to fill it up but it's nice to have it. It has given me no problem so far.,5,Pozitif
These are great little cards and are very fast. The only thing I hate about microSD is that they are so dang small and the slots are spring loaded. I have lost a couple from them shooting across the room.,4,Pozitif
"Ayyy what can you say. It works. It used to have a delay for my phone recognizing it and all the data on it, but that may be a phone problem. Got it for $42.99 on black friday. Can't knock it at all. *****FIVE STARS*****",5,Pozitif
Used it in my Galaxy Note 2 for the past 16 months. All the sudden it is no longer writable. I tried many ways to reformat the card. Even Windows says format successful but all files remain after I remove and re-insert the card. Since I have private files in the card I'm not able to delete. I do not want to sent it back to SanDisk for replacement.,2,Negatif
"I use this in the S2, works great, movies, pictures, passworded storage areas, everything is working fine after 6 months! Your mileage may vary, good luck.",5,Pozitif
A well made replacement part for use with my system.  Reads and writes quickly to my camera.  The down side:  I do not like the size of this card.  Very tiny and often difficult to remove from my Canon camera.  Not a reflection on the San Disk card quality but the industry move into micro-miniture cards.  I won't buy another camera using micro SD cards.,4,Pozitif
A cheaper alternative than buying a tablet with more storage. Shipped promptly and the price was reasonable..I will probably purchase another.,4,Pozitif
I shouldn't run out of room for a long time plays videos great and my camera is plenty fast with this mostly it's going to hold music on my Casio G'zOne Commando 4G LTE this works great on all I've tested and a great price,5,Pozitif
Already many reviews on the product so i just wanted to say i have a few of them and these cards are just plain solid and priced right as well. Hope to see the 128 gb soon.,5,Pozitif
"This works on my phone and is amazing, however it seems to transfer pretty slowly.  I move a lot of music and movies on and off my phone so it can be annoying.  I'm not sure if my phone or this card is the weak link though.  I have Note 2.Anyways, it was cheap and it works, that is all that matters.  Buy it!!!",4,Pozitif
The last I heard this memory card works great. I gave it as a Christmas gift. The person I gave it to says it works great.,5,Pozitif
"My wife's Razr M has been a great phone to date. I matched it with what I thought would be a great memory card, having been a long time Sandisk Ultra user in my photography.Sadly after 3 months, without warning, the card mysteriously ""bricked"". Unreadable by her phone, two PCs and one Mac .. the only thing that can even SEE the card is my Droid Bionic - which says the card is unreadable and needs to be formatted. I am hesitant in the very odd chance I can still recover the many gigs of photos and videos of our 6 month old baby which were not backed up.I could not be any more disappointed in this product.",1,Negatif
seems to be working just fine...bought as a gift for a family member and they're using it for video recording.,4,Pozitif
Great Great Deal!!!! I bought this for a Really good price ($25) after i bought my Brand New Galaxy S4. I looked in stores and found the same Micro SD card selling for $60-80. This works straight out of the box and I have had no issues at all with it. Buy it Now!,5,Pozitif
"Bought this for my Note 10.1 for some extra space(also use one in my Note 2) No problem being recognized. Now if only Samsung would let me install apps on it, but that's not the cards fault.",5,Pozitif
Doesn't work in my s2 skyrocket but works in my Xoom. Odd but I have to suffer with it. Seems about the same as my class 4. Will not get sandisk again unless its tons cheaper. 1 was stolen by some tweakers which sucks,3,Negatif
Works perfect in the Surface RT. Easily integrated into the file structure by using the Libraries function of Win RT.,5,Pozitif
"Works Great!  I was running out of room on my 32GB card on my Galaxy Note 3.  This solved my problems nicely!  Now I have enough space for movies, music and photos on my device!  I don't think I will be running out of space for a while!",5,Pozitif
"Works like a dream with my S3 smartphone, used for camera pics storage, videos and music; really enhances the capability and flexibility of any device with the slot.",5,Pozitif
"i know what my title says, and it's the actual amount on the card, which is really good. other cards that i own have a greater difference per advertised amount. i use it for my lenovo lynx tablet and it works perfectly.",5,Pozitif
"hello,we have been using sandisk memory cards since the beginning of sd cards.  this latest version was recommended for my samsung galaxy 4s phone.  with the zillion photos, videos and apps, the original 16/13gb of space was becoming full and not saving due to ""lack of space.""  so, the sandisk micro sd card was the answer.  pop the back off easily on the phone, slip the mini sd card into the provided slot, make sure it ""clicks"" in and put the phone cover back on the unit.  it is as simple as that.  now, i have 32 gb of extra space and my new phone stores anything i want to store.  (i constantly make backups to my home computer...very easy)  the connection simply shows the phone data and the sd card data when connected to the home computer.  i transferred my largest photo/video file to the sd card.  now the original 12gb is open for more instant quality photos and videos.  when the original card gets loaded again.  13meg camera takes super quality photos and videos, but also takes up a lot of space.adding a micro sd card is less expensive than ordering a 32gb galaxy4s, but yrmv  great productupdate...  the original ""super large"" file that is on the sd card still shows up on the original gallery screen.  it still has the same functions, but my original 16gb shows more room for the next zillion photos, etc.",5,Pozitif
It was good until I lost it in the house.  I think they should put a big ass light on it so I won't loose it.,5,Pozitif
"It's a memory card, stores memory well, no problems after 2 months of use in my Note 2. Great price online.",5,Pozitif
"I had bought this card for my new Samsung Galaxy S3. The card is about as good as you can expect for the price and technology you're paying for.SDXC cards come formatted in exFAT by default, which is what I would have tried to format it as anyway and seen if my phone supports that filesystem. In addition to being a faster format, enabling higher transfer rates, exFAT also takes up less storage space than, say, an FAT or FAT32 filesystem would - which is important when considering mobile storage devices.I read several poor reviews about this product starting that it simply stopped working after a few months. While that can happen from regular use, as it has happened to me in the past with a couple 32GB SDHCs, I would venture to say it was an error in use. Flash media is very sensitive in regards to ""hard shutdowns"". that's to say, just pulling it out of your device or card reader without first unmounting it. Within the 'Data Storage' menu on Android phones, there is an option to 'unmount SD card'. I would recommend that you ALWAYS select this before removing any external memory card to avoid corruption of data and, ultimately, the card itself. The reason for this is that sudden stoppage of a flash memory device's data or power connectivity can easily result in corruption.Transversely, if you have the memory card plugged into a card reader, say, with an SD adapter; you should first ""Eject"" the card. In Windows, there is a small icon located in the taskbar notification menu for ""Safely Remov[ing] Hardware and Eject[ing] Media"". Select the card and a notification will pop-up that the card is now safe to remove. It basically severs the same function as the Android 'unmount' optional but will also cease any current read/write operations to avoid data or device corruption.Icannot speak for how one would do this on a Mac OS but chances are, if you're using an Apple PC, you don't have an Android phone.",5,Pozitif
This is the best in its kind... works really fast. beside I like the color of this micro sd card,5,Pozitif
"We ordered these and used them in my Galaxy Note 2 and my wife's Razr M. After a few months we noticed that they would cause the phone to freeze up. The phones would start showing that it was mounting and unmounting the SD card early on but toward the end they just froze up the phone. Once we trashed the cards, the phones worked fine. We bought a different brand and no trouble since. I don't know why these red & gray ones have issues but stay away from them.",1,Negatif
This ultra micro-sd card is faster than the standard micro-sd cards. However the adapter provided with the card is not good. Data Transfer was quicker when used with a different adapter than the one provided with the micro-sd card,5,Pozitif

The memory card works well in both my LG Optimus L9 (YES!!) as well as my Galaxy Note 10.1 Tablet. The card worked native on the Note but I had to reformat it to work with my phone (reformatting on the phone itself). It has the correct capacity and seems the correct speed.,5,Pozitif

"At the time, this was one of the best you can get.  Even now, at UHS-1, you will be doing better than the older, slower chips.  The form factor is handy for products which can take the Micro SD.",5,Pozitif
"64GB is pretty good size, and in a cell phone, it's awesome. However, getting it formatted as FAT32 is not the easiest method. By default, Windows 7 will not allow anything larger than 32GB to be formatted as FAT32. Even if you execute a DOS command to format to FAT32, it will fail. There is a fix though. Ridgecrop Consultants Ltd has a program that can be downloaded. I would suggest that you support this free application by sending the guy a few bucks, as he has truly written a great program that works very well in Windows 7. I have used his program, &#34;fat32format&#34; to successfully format this 64GB MicroSDXC disk. I then copied all of my contents from my old 12GB disk to this one. I inserted the disk into my phone, and whalla! It works great! Very pleased with this purchase.",5,Pozitif

This little memory card is quite fast and it gives me a ton of expansion storage on my Galaxy S3. File transfers from the phone's internal storage or over a USB connection to my PC from the card when it it's in my phone are a lot faster than I anticipated.

There's no way I can give this a bad rating because it does exactly what it's supposed to do andthat's espand the memory.

The apps for tablet are automatically downloaded to the memory card and I have had no issues or complaints.,5,Pozitif
"I got it for my Galaxy S4 and it works well. It has a good speed and good space which is something I definitely needed. Sometimes it has a hard time getting recognized in my computer, but I always find a way to make it work. It will not do NTFS, but its not necessary for my purposes.",5,Pozitif

"I was working with a three of these cards using the included adapter, and thought they were slower than they should be.  I just bought a full size Sandisk Ultra 16GB class 10 (all the same specs except size theoretically) for a different project, and it writes over twice as fast on the same computer! The write speed on this card is between 7 and 10 MB/s, the read seems to be 35MB/s, compared to the full size card with write speed of 22 to 25MB/s and a read speed of 42MB/s (this is from an imaging program, not a benchmark program, so it's not checking different sizes of transfer and the like).  Compare that with a Transcend 4 GB Class 4 card, the write speed is nearly identical (7 to 9MB/s), while the read speed on the class four is 12 to 13MB/s, significantly slower, as expected.The read speed is good, but the write speed is abysmal!  If it says ""Class 10"", it should be somewhat close to the Class 10 spec.I'm returning them.",2,Negatif
"Installed as sublimental memory for Samsung Tab 3 8 inch tablet.  Doesn't look like apps can be installed on the card, but that is a Tab 3 issue, not a San Disk issue.  Something to think about when chosing your tablet.  I plan on installing a lot of memory hogging field guide apps, so theTab 3's 16 GB built in memory may be a problem for me.  On the other hand, I have a lot of music, so the SD card will be useful.",5,Pozitif

"I purchased this to increase the storage on my tablet. Plugged in and worked immediately and was very affordable. I am not a tech expert but it seems to have no problem saving large video clips and playing them back. There was 1 cheaper than this, but this seemed to have better reviews so I went with this one. It was about half the cost of the cheapest one I could find at the big box store.",5,Pozitif

"I got my memory card here instead of on the gopro site and saved some money. Its the same card and it works awesome. This card is about 7 hours of 720 @30 frames per second, or about 4 hours of 720@60 frames or 1080 @30 frames. In a gopro, you will be burning through batteries way before you could ever fill these cards. I prefer more, smaller cards. If a card dies, it is less of a catastrophe and you also dont pay that premium for the larger cards. However, If I do a LONG time lapse with a battery source, having a large card is nice to have.",5,Pozitif

Worked great, two 32 GB cards were just a little cheaper than one of these and I wanted my nephew to upgrade to 128 GB if he wanted.  The adapter didn't say it would work with XC and we were worried that the PSP would have a problem with it but it all worked out great.  He is upgrading to 64 GB from 2 GB, it was a little overwhelming.  He has lots more space now and might get another one of these cards to put in the same adapter.

"I bought this card because I have several devices that use microSD cards, but not all of them are compatible with the newer and higher-capacity SDXC standard. For SDHC memory cards, 32GB is the largest size available under that technology standard, so I went with this one from Sandisk. That way I didn't have to worry about compatibility issues with any of my devices. I've used Sandisk memory products for a number of years along with many other brands, and I've always had good results from them. I'm happy to say that my experience with this card echoes that of 5,000+ other Amazon users; it's been rock steady, reliable with larger file transfers (several 2GB+ movies at a time), and performed as quickly as I'd hoped for a Class 10 card in regards to its read/write times.Aside from the existing reviews and my previous experiences with Sandisk products, I also picked up this particular card due to its UHS-1 compliance. I don't currently have any UHS-1 devices that can take advantage of the increased speed, but for the negligible cost difference, it just made sense. Standards and technology update so fast these days; any future-proofing a product can provide to extend its usable life is always appreciated.",5,Pozitif

"This has really just been used to store some extra files and pass between computers. It came with the converter to change it to a standard SD card. No issues with either. It always amazes me how so much data can be stored in such a small space. Anyway, it will get more use in the next month. I'm planning on upgrading phones and will knock it down a star if it seems to slow to record video to. So if you just see 5 stars, it means I am lazy and the disk is still good.",5,Pozitif

"The card was working great. I own quite a few for several of my devices. One that I bough in 2012 suddenly died. I went to the SanDisk website and did a chat support. The Tech tried some quick troubleshooting and after about five minutes asked for my info for an RMA. The process was quick and easy. Like I said, this one suddenly died, no idea why. Luckily I didn't have anything important on it at the time. This is the only one I've ever had fail, and like I said, the RMA process was a breeze. I really like these cards and the customer service was great. For reference, I run these cards in a Samsung Galaxy SII (hercules) - 32 gb, Motorola Droid (sholes) - 16 gb, Motorola Droid 3 (solana) - 32 gb, Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2012) (GT-N8013) -32 gb, it was the Note one that failed. I also have a GoPro but I run the golden SanDisk cards in that, but they are twice the price! I will continue to buy these cards regardless of this isolated incident.",4,Pozitif

"The Nexus One is listed as supporting a maximum of 32GB on an SDCard.Based on  reports here and elsewhere, I took out my 32GB card and put in this 64GB card and powered up the phone.The phone reported that the card was defective in a notification.I pulled down the notifications and tapped the notification that issued that report.  It offered to format the card.I would note that I have Clockwork Recovery and the ROM Manager app installed on my rooted (CM7, Android 2.3) N1.After tapping the notification, the phone formatted the card.  All went well.  Since I had neglected to move my RootExplorer file manager off the SD card prior to putting in the new card, I was not able to check directly on the phonethat the entire 64GB was available.  But, as it turned out, it was.While doing the above, I had been using Winzip to make a copy of the contents of my 32GB card to my PC (using a USB adapter).  When that completed,I powered down the phone and put the new 64GB card in the PC using the Micro SD adapter that came with that card and a USB adapter for that adapter.It showed about 60GB (the usual for a 64GB card, I guess).Interestingly, some files (mainly folders) related to clockworkmod had been placed on the SD card during formatting, which shows where the formatting codeprobably came from.  Take note: if you do *not* have ROM Manager / Clockworkmod on your phone, your mileage may very well vary.  If you have root, I would suggest obtainingROM Manager from Google Play prior to doing the above.  Anyway, I just deleted those files so that they wouldn't conflict with any of the old files I was aboutto copy.I then unzipped the saved contents of my old card onto the new card.Then, I put the new card in the N1 and powered it up.  It worked perfectly, right away.Root Explorer showed about 60GB of capacity (of which about 30 was used by me - I really needed this card!).Tried out Spotify Premium and it played fine from saved files that had been on the old card and were now transferred to the new card.  Other thanRoot Explorer, haven't tried any other apps yet, but am expecting good news based on the experience thus far!I tried a full backup using ROM Manager and it apparently worked without incident.So, based on the above, I would recommend this card for the Nexus One!  What a break to get another 30 GB on an aging phonethat is nonetheless still one of the best phones ever.Caveat: Keep in mind that I just unwrapped this thing and have used it for all of two hours.",5,Pozitif

I have this in my phone storing the majority of my MP3 collection (400+ albums). It loaded 30Gs of music comparatively fast.

"I'm amazed.  I ordered this from Amazon on Tuesday morning, and it arrived with Wednesday's mail.  VERY impressive service from Amazon!As has already been reported, the card formats out to > 59 Gb, and it performs perfectly in my Samsung Galaxy S III (which is also new).  Using two card readers on a fast PC, I transferred everything from my old 16GB card to the new 64 GB card in less time than it took to walk to the kitchen and get a cup of coffee.  So I think the Class 10 rating is correct on the card.Once I have some experience with the card in the phone, I'll benchmark the card and I'll also benchmark operations such as internally backing up my Android phone to the card.  Then I'll update this review with some accurate numerical data.  But in the mean time on first look, the person who said that the S 3 has problems with anything faster than class 6 may not have been correct - a full backup of the phone to the card was significantly faster than the backup with the old 16GB class 6 card.  Again no benchmarks yet but once I have them I'll include them here.Right now I'm very happy with this card and I'm really impressed - both with the card and with the unbelievably quick service from Amazon (and I'm in Atlanta where shipments like this one often take the full 3 days to arrive).",5,Pozitif
"I bought this for a Sansa Clip+, it worked after formatting the card to FAT32.  Can't say much other than I have tons of lossless songs here that were previously on CDs.  What I don't like in general is that manufacturers LIE about real size of cards arguing some technical issue, it's like saying that 2+2=5, when in reality is not, this card like any other card is not 64gb, it's more like 62gb (can't remember exact size, don't have card available at hand).2+2 is not =5.  This card is advertised as 64gb yet in reality is lower, manufactures using false advertising as usual. This kinds of memory cards are a good example of false advertisement.",5,Negatif

That's less than %50 of the advertised transfer rate.To be fair, I've used the same external card reader with my Sony HX100 digital camera with an SD card (16Gb class 10) and I get double the transfer rate of what I've gotten for this card.Here is the setup:1- SD Adapter included with this card.2- External 12-in-1 USB 2.0 card reader connected to a USB 2.0 port on my PC3- Files transferred were of varying sizes.4- Transferred from 2TB Seagate X2 SATA3 HDD (connected to SATA2 port)5- Windows 8 Enterprise x64 (oh yah baby)The only excuse I give this card for its bad performance is the files were relatively small sizes but some of them were as large as 50Mb...

I've never had a problem with SanDisk products.  Just make sure your camera or device can actually use 32GB -- some are limited to 16GB.,5,Pozitif
Great card. Now they need to make a more 128 gb cards so I can buy one of those without having to pay double. 200 bucks..?  No thanks.,5,Notr
came quick and works well with my galaxy s4. formating was simple. its a sandisk not much that could be wrong with it.,5,Pozitif

"If you use one of the  larger MP  taking camera ( 12-14-16 etc)  you need this card.  Taking photos on those kinds of cameras really chews up the smaller MP cards.  Don't go on vacation without at least 1 of these babies, or you'll be having to carry lots of cards and probably end up losing one and your memories.",5,Pozitif
I bought this to use I'm my Galaxy note 10.1 tablet. So far so good. Simple put into microsd slot and began storing data on it,4,Pozitif

I'm not going to give you a detailed speed and what not but this SD card is fast compared to the other ones. You wouldn't really notice the difference in speed unless you're copying a huge file. I use this on my Note 2 and I take a butt load of pictures with my phone.,5,Pozitif
"I had no issue using this with all of the above devices. It is still working strong and I trust SanDisk with all my gear including memory for DSLR use. Had not malfunctioned throughout many different uses and I trust this brand. Although it is more expensive as supposed to other brands, but they are worth extra in my opinion.",5,Pozitif
"After extensive review / research I wanted the best 64gb available to improve/increase memory for Samsung tab 3 7.0 many cards out there but this one loaded up quickly and appears to be ready for add on apps and preserving meory storage.

"I had the card about 3 months in my Galaxy S 4 and then it suddenly went into a read only mode. All the data was still there and I was able to copy it all from the card but could not write or format the card. I searched the internet high and low for a solution and then finally contacted Sandisk support. After explaining my problem, they said it will need to be replaced and it would be covered under warranty. The replacement process took about two weeks, they paid for return shipping. I now have the 2nd card and have had it running for about 2 weeks now.We'll see if I just happened to get a bad one or if they all are of questionable quality.",4,Notr
"never looked to verify the capacity of this card, it is clearly labeled 64gb but when installed it clearly is not. When installed into any computer it shows 27.4gb available with 1.68 used. So beware if you order one to make sure you are getting what you pay for.",1,Negatif
"I bought this Memory card because of the Sandisk Reputation and the Class 10 speed, I use this for my Samsung Galaxy Tablet, the Class 10 speed is really impressive! The Memory card can write to memory pictures as fast as you can take them, loading music is almost Instantaneous and a 5 minute Music video loads in about 4 seconds!

I copied about 30GB of data from my computer HD to this card and it took over 8 hours.Of course, since that was a one-time thing, I didn't really mind.  It works great in my Microsoft Surface Pro.  I just cannot believe that I could find a 64GB micro SDXC card for under $50.  The sale is over, of course, and I've not been able to find them this cheap since.I would buy another one if it were comparably priced.",4,Pozitif
"WORKS great, better than I thought - IF you cave a SURFACE TABLET  I truly recommend it it will work straight away.",5,Pozitif
"This tiny marvel does what it claims.  The only possible problem is that it is SO small that you may lose it if you happen to drop it during handling.  But with 16 GB capacity, you won't be handling it often.",5,Pozitif
Great little micro sd card!  The 64 GB of storage is awesome.  Very dependable brand.  I have this brand  for other devices and always works like a charm!,5,Pozitif

"I purchased this card based on the price.  After I ordered it I finally started reading some of the reviews and started getting worried about whether the card was going to work.  Seems that a lot of people have been having problems getting the phone to recognize the card and then, if needed, formatting the card.When the card arrived I put it in my phone and it immediately was recognized by my android system (JB 4.1.1).  I had already copied all the music, pics and video off my older, slower and smaller card onto my computer so all I had to do was plug the phone into the computer, open the card and copy everything into it.  Everything went in with no problem.  I then unplugged it from the computer and tested my videos and music on the phone and everything worked like a charm.Bottom line, I did not have to format the card, I just plugged it into the phone, it was immediately recognized and worked like a charm.I would highly recommend this card based on the price and the product that you are receiving.",5,Pozitif
"I placed this memory card in my Bluetooth speaker, I then loaded it up with different genders of music and it plays beatifully.",5,Pozitif
"As advertised, specs match.  As long as the device you as using it in can handle it (i.e. USB 3.0, not some crapple bs) it delivers the advertised speed.  P.S. The speed is READ, not WRITE, but you knew that, right?",5,Pozitif
"Since there are almost three thousands reviews already, I bet almost everything about reading and writing speeds have been covered. I'll just try to provide some specifics from my experience in case if somebody is searching with these keywords. I've copied some WAV and MP3 files to this card from a fast PC (3.4 GHz, 16GB RAM, 7,200 RPM HDD, 64-bit Win 7, etc.) with a built-in card reader. The card reader maybe my bottleneck. Anyway, the observed average writing speed was around 9.5MB/s.Tried this card in Nokia 3555b. Logically this phone cannot read more than 8GB MicroSDHC cards, but it it. However, it saw the card as being only a 2GB card. Tried inMotorola Flipout Unlocked GSM Quad-Band Android Phone with Bluetooth, Camera, QWERTY Keyboard and Wi-Fi - Unlocked Phone - US Warranty - Black. Played those WAV and MP3 files and it worked very well. Tried inMotorola MB520 Bravo Unlocked Phone with Android OS, 3MP Camera, FM Radio and GPS - US Warranty - Blackwith the same files, and it worked well too. No hiccups. Then inserted (and left it in) inBLU Studio 5.3 II Unlocked Dual Sim Phone with Dual-Core 1GHz Processor, Android 4.1, 5.3-inch IPS Capacitive Touch, and 8MP Camera - U.S. Warranty (Black). So far so good. Will update this review if problems will arise.It was sold and fulfilled by Amazon in a frustration-free packaging. I love this packaging not only because it does not have nasty blister pack that cuts your fingers, but also because it is eco-friendly.",5,Pozitif

I'm able to have my music with me at all times, plus a large number of photos.One item to note: this type of memory card may not be suitable for high speed applications (such as with a camera or for storing virtual hard drive type information).  These micro cards are a 5 star if used for their intended purpose.",5,Pozitif
"I purchased the Sandisk Ultra 32GB microSDHC for some extra storage room for my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. I was considering the 64 GB, but went with this card because I have the 64GB version on my Galaxy Note 2 phone and I have never come close to needing all that space. Granted, I don't store any music on my phone but I do take a lot of photos/videos and store as many apps on the microSDHC card rather than use the phone's internal memory.For the cost savings of going with the smaller 32GB card, it was a no brainer.The card has worked flawlessly since I installed it on my tablet and have had no problems with it whatsoever. Plus Sandisk is a big name in storage so again, it's a no brainer--- buy it!",4,Pozitif
"There is a lot of conflicting info on the we about whether cards larger than 32gb work in this phone. The phone specs say that it only supports up to 32gb.

The memory works fine in my Motorola Razor-M cell phone allowing me to store movies, pictures, and music that I can play on my phone.  The adapter, on the other hand, feels flimsy and fragile.  I had trouble inserting it into two different readers and even then it felt like like it was going to break.  I have several other adapters and this adapter feels like the material is much thinner than the others.  Having said that, I didn't purchase the memory for the adapter I purchased it for the speed rating and compatibility.  All things being equal I would consider purchasing the memory again.",3,Notr

"I have two of these that I am using with a GoPro HERO3 and they work great (I will be getting more!).  While I could do the 64GB, I (so far) am preferring the 32GB, because the card is about full right when a battery reaches the end of it's life so I can swap a card and battery at the same time and save opening/closing the case and swapping parts all of the time.  The card is plenty fast, never had any hiccups with that and they have proven to be quite reliable as I have a 3rd card that I have been using in multiple mobile phones (HTC and BB) since 2010 and have never had any problem at all with any of them.",5,Pozitif

"I bought two of the 32 GB Sandisk Ultra microSDHC cards, and both of them were unusable.The first one stopped accepting new data when I had put a bit less than one gig of data onto the card.  I couldn't add more files, and I couldn't reformat the card. If I tried to write a new file onto the card, the write operation seemed as if it worked, but the new data couldn't be read back successfully.  The files already on the card were still readable, though, so basically, the card had become a 1 GB ROM.  Fortunately, there was no sensitive personal information on the card, so I returned it to Amazon.The second one didn't fail the same way, but it was still unusable.  If I transferred a bunch of files and then read them back, most of the transferred files had data errors.  For example, a 3 minute music file might only be able to have it's first minute of music played back, then the bad data would stop the music player.  I ran a write/readback test and confirmed that there were data errors on nearly every block tested.  (I used Flash_Drive_Tester_v114.exe, which is a free download.)I ended up buying the equivalent Transcend productTranscend Information TS32GUSDC10 32GB micro SDHC10 Flash Memory - No Box or Adapterwhich has been performing flawlessly.

On a recent trip abroad, during which I took 3000 pictures...sometimes using the panorama function...I never ran into any processing delays.  The camera and card let me just keep snapping.  Cards like this are noticed only if they don't perform.  They are otherwise just &#34;there,&#34; which is a good thing.  This one seems to perform.

"Recently I bought a Microsoft Surface RT tablet and used the 32GB version of this memory card. Worked great and I didn't have any problems. So, when I heard that the Surface RT could be expanded to 64GB, I immediately looked for a great deal online. Behold... Amazon offered this card for under $50 AND it was Prime eligible! Woo-Hoo! To me, it was a &#34;no-brainer&#34; and I quickly ordered this inexpensive upgrade. Like its predecessor, it comes with the memory card, an SD card adapter, and a small plastic case. installing the card is super easy on the Surface, because you just line it up with the slot and push it in till it clicks! That's it! No formatting required and the card runs quite fast! Normally, I buy SanDisk Extreme memory cards (which are faster), but this particular card had no problem running video files or playing music.Anyway, if you get this card for your Surface RT tablet, DON'T format it! Why? Well, the card is already formatted, so why risk messing up your card? Just pop it in and enjoy greater space on your Surface!Note: As far as I know, you cannot install Surface apps onto the memory card, only media files and documents.

After trying to format it a number of different ways, I finally contacted sandisk, and they said they will send me a replacement free of charge. I would have maybe given this a lower rating, but the customer service from sandisk made up for the faulty card. I am just glad it fell under a warranty period (I think).

"I own the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 smartphone- and besides having a user-replaceable battery, this device also allows the user to pop in a Micro SD card.

If you own the iPhone, not so great, there are no user-accessible batteries or Micro SD cards in iPhones.  If you own Android- well, life will be considerably brighter once you pop this in, which took all of like 30 seconds.

Don't cut corners, almost every other brand of SD cards will fail on you except these (tried numerous brands with my devices).Just remember it takes a bit for devices to buffer the information off of the SD card and static can corrupt any SD card which is usually easily fixed with a formatting. Always back up your documents to a PC/Mac as soon as possible.Oh, and if you create playlists, slideshows, etc. on devices and remove the SD card, the device will not be smart enough to re-compile it after you put the SD card back in and you will end up with blank playlists even though you have the songs so WATCH OUT!Lastly if this SD card doesn't work for you for whatever reason google SD card formatting and it should help you out.

I had some feeling it&#8217;s even possible for me to get the 128 GB version to work as well on this phone. To make sure that it is fully compatible, I did a reformat using the phone of the SD card.

I find that only a few pieces of my equipment can access it - apparently some older firmware devices do not recognize 64 GB SD. One trick I found - I was able to format this in my tablet, then move it into my phone. Initially, my phone reported it as a corrupt SD. Other than that, I have had no issues with it - it is reliable and stable, but not lightning fast. It took me over two hours to copy my photos and music onto it.",4,Notr

"While the class 10 speed is excellent (it's amazing when files will initially transfer at 200MB/s before settling down to ~19), you do need to use a reader with proper SDXC support, and manually format the card in a good partitioning program, like minitools or easeus. That alone should disqualify it from 5 stars, for lack of user-friendliness. But if it weren't for that, the fast, roomy card is a wonder to own.",4,Notr

I was so excited to see how much faster the write/read speeds would be.It worked great at first but then my phone started to tell me that it was unrecognizable and it kept ejecting it. I thought maybe it was a formatting issue so I reformatted it from my phone (Galaxy S4) but it just did the same thing.After a week of this I was very irritated and decided to give up and just return it and get another one. I was scared that it would do the same thing because many other people had issues with these cards in the galaxy's.To my surprise the new 32GB card that amazon sent back to me has been working great where as the other one would have been ejecting every other hour.I am really happy with amazon and their return policy. It was very fast and easy, I can honestly say I've never returned something so fast and so easy, they literally sent it next day delivery and at no cost to me.The only reason I gave it one star off is because I had to return the first one, other than that the product has been great so farI am extremely happy with amazon's service.As far as the SD card I'd definitely get another one if it worked like the one I have now.",4,Pozitif
"i got this for my GoPro hero3 and so far its working great. The GoPro's really eat up the flash memory so I bought 3 of the 32 GB models. i suggest that unless you are going on a particularly long scuba dive or adventure, you should get the 32 GB over the 64 GB cards as it spreads out the risk of any one card failure causing loss of all your videos.",5,Pozitif

"I got my wife a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 for Christmas, and it took awhile for her to start figuring out all the things it can do.  Once she did, that led, of course, to her wanting to watch movies on it.  That was my signal to spring into action, that is, if I wanted to prevent her from running wild, buying ""digital copies"" of every movie we already have in DVD or Blu-Ray.  You can't play DVD or Blu-Ray movies on this device, but you CAN use your computer's DVD or Blu-Ray drive and commonplace third-party software to convert movies in this format into "".mp4"" and/or several other types of video files that CAN be played on this tablet.Since this particular tablet is capable of playing high-definition video (screen resolution is 1280 x 800 pixels), and we want to use ALL of that high-def capability, my conversion files tend to be pretty large (average 5 to 10GB per movie) ... way too big to be stored on the tablet's limited internal memory.  That's where the tablet's microSD slot ... and this SanDisk flash memory ... comes in.  I make HUGE mp4's, store them separately on a 1.5 terabyte drive, and then load as many of them as I can on this chip, which shows up in the tablet as a separate memory source.  Then all you have to do is pull up one of the movie files from the card, and hit play.  You can use the device's standard video player, or get an app with more controls.Watching high-def video on a tablet that's streaming the data from a memory card (rather than the tablet's internal memory) requires a memory card with very high ""read speed,"" and this SanDisk card's ""Class 10"" rating fills that bill.  That's the difference between cheaper microSD that's primarily designed for simple data storage, and microSD that's designed for higher active transfer/read speeds.  The ""Class 10"" designation generally means that the subject card will transfer data at a MINIMUM rate of 10MB per second.  This SanDisk ""Ultra"" card is capable of transferring data at speeds of up to 30MB per second, depending on the speed of the device you're using it in, and other particulars of the way you're using the device.""Frustration free packaging"" means the chip, SD adapter, and plastic case comes in a little, sealed cardboard envelope with a pull tab opener.  This card comes pre-formatted for Android, and my use of it in the Galaxy Tab 3 for watching high-def .mp4 movies has thus far been flawless.Finally, don't let yourself get burned by counterfeiters in trying to save a buck.  While pricing on memory tends to fluctuate, Amazon's current pricing on this card is VERY competitive with any/all vendors out there selling GENUINE SanDisk ""Ultra"" memory.  Buy from Amazon, or other trustworthy vendor, because I just learned the hard way that these memory cards are being counterfeited in huge numbers ... that is, the counterfeiters are placing SanDisk labeling/packaging on inferior, generic microSD, and selling the bogus chips on Ebay and anywhere else they can.  I bought THREE from Amazon after I got burned by a Chinese seller on Ebay.  The counterfeit packaging and labeling was good enough to fool me, until I actually tried one of the chips in the Galaxy Tab 3 ... the write speed (that is, the amount of time it takes to transfer files ONTO the microSD card) was dramatically worse than the speed of a genuine SanDisk ""Ultra"" card, and the read speed was totally inadequate for playing movies on the Galaxy Tab 3.  I may never have figured it out at all if I didn't already have one other, genuine SanDisk ""Ultra"" with which to compare the fakes.If you want the best, most reliable memory for the microSD slot on your shiny, new Android device, look no further ... this is it.",5,Pozitif

"I'm using this in a SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 16GB unlocked smartphone and the only problem is as you write more and more flies to the card it gets slower and slower to the point that you'll be so p.o at a crucial moment , say for example you want  to access a video  or doc , that when you do actually get your file you've lost  all faith in the card .So buy it for the capacity but always remember it's not reliable  for fast access.",3,Negatif

"I don't want to write a review for each of the 8, 16, 32, and 64 GB SanDisk MicroSDHC Class 10 Cards. They're all 5 stars. They're extremely fast, and as Class 10s, have allowed my Canon SX50's shutter to speed up because it transfers information so quickly with the camera's very small processor. They also allow a burst mode of 9-13 fps which is amazing for a non-DSLR.These cards are also very reliable. I've had no read/write failures in the two years that I've been using them.The one &#34;negative&#34; is that they're so small and can be dropped easily when getting them out of the adapter. Still, if you've been working with computers since there was a gerbil running the power for your PC, you have to marvel at how anything this small can hold more than 30,000 high def 6 GB photos on a 64 GB card that is smaller than your pinky nail.",5,Pozitif

"I'm a music lover and like to carry my entire music collection around with me everywhere I go. That being said it takes up A LOT of space, enough to fill a 64gb memory card on its own (a lot of the files are FLAC format.) I was a little hesitant to buy the 128gb card when it came out recently because with the 64gb cards the first batch were pretty much defective with resulted in a recall. Me, learning of the recall after looking up the issues I was having had to return the card I bought. SanDisk took the 64gb card back without hesitation and was actually prepared to do it without the serial number (since I couldn't open my phone at the time because the case is screwed on.)Note to everyone:Quite a few applications don't fully support NTFS or newer file system formats such as exFAT. To use your SD card without issues you have to format it to FAT32 which IS possible even though its over 32GB. Use the &#34;Fat32Format&#34; tool made by Ridgecrop Consultants, there's a GUI (Graphical User Interface) version available for those unfamiliar with using the command line.------After receiving my new card I formatted it to fat32 since I use a lot of applications that aren't the norm and it's easier to use an older file system that is compatible with everything made after 1996. The transfer of files and swapping of cards was seamless, my computer's micro-sd card reader recognized it without trouble as well as my phone. So far everything is good and there's been no hiccups.

Worked for awhile and then android would blow chunks (unexpectedly removed).  Windows sometimes could not read them and just blew up explorer.  Formated FAT32 .... ect ect ect over and over.  I'm done with SanDisk.  I think the problem is the CLASS 10 part of these cards.  All other cards I have work fine and they are less than class 10.  Maybe this was a bad batch because my replacement card a few days later (from Amazon) did the same thing again.EDIT: Decided to pick up the card that was laying on my counter for the last 3 months and give things another try.

In fairness to ADATA, who failed to make good on any of the several defective products I purchased from them, I have never had to test SanDisk's warranty as I've never had a failure.

"Hi:I ordered two card and they arrived the next day, even faster than Prime. Unfortunatey, this 64gb MicroSD card is designed to only work with ex-fat. If you're an ex-fat fan and don't ever plan to change, this is the card for you. I've been able to take all of the previous 64gb MicroSD cards I've ordered, put them in an adapter and format them in my Windows 7 desktop. I'm a NTSF fan and find it to be much more stable in tablets.With other cards that aren't intentionally crippled, I can format the card to NTSF on Monday, ex-fat on Tuesday, Fat32 on Wednesday. It's ex-fat or the highway for SanDisk.You can use EaseUS Partition Master to format the card to Fat32 for devices such as cameras and mp3 players and many, many, many others that don't support ex-fat. That being said, you only get one shot. Once it's formatted into Fat32, attempting to format back to Exfat or NTSF hoses the card. I couldn't reformat to NTSF no matter what I tried. Once again, don't bother trying to format in your computer, ex-fat is the only choice.Any card that needs a special utility to format to anything other than ex-fat shouldn't be supported. Don't buy it! It's designed to fail.Shame on you Sandisk!Update 9/24/12:***************************I spoke with Sandisk technical support and they confirmed that Sandisk Ultra 64gb MicroSd cards are not compatible with Android 4.0 and above. This would be for Class 10, SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQUA-064G-U46A as well as SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 30MB/s Memory Card with SD Adapter (NEW VERSION) - Retail Packaging with Komputerbay SDXC USB Reader.I did not have any success formatting the class 10 card with EaseUS Partition Master. SanDisk recommended the free utility, HPUSBDISK.exe and I successfully downloaded it from Softpedia. I was  unable to format the card with NTSF but successfully converted one of the cards to Fat32 for a friend who wants to use it in a SanDisk mp3 player, that of course is not compatible with ex-fat.Acting on Sandisk advice I am returning the unopened class ten cards with the KomputerBay reader. I spoke with a patient and gracious tier-one tech support person and the party line seems be that consumers only use MicroSD cards in phones. I don't know what they're thinking: cameras, mp3 players, tablets, adapters and so on. Anyway it's a known issue.I can confirm that the class 6  64gb MicroSD card can be formatted in Windows7 back and forth to most any format so after returning four class 10 cards, I'm back to class six.It's still unconscionable to deliberately design these cards to be incompatible. I hope SanDisk will come up with a solution or recall the cards. Buyer beware.Update: 9/29/12**********************I received my two replacement class 6, 64gb MicroSD cards and it took less than five minutes to open the horrible packaging and to perform a quick format to NTSF. Done!I gave my friend the Class 10 64gb MicroSD card formatted into Fat32 by HPUSBDISK.EXE and he couldn't read it on his computer. As it turns out, the class 10 cards are not only incompatible with most devices bur also with most usb card readers.  Another trip across town.I can confirm that the IOGEAR SD/MicroSD/MMC Card Reader/Writer GFR204SD (Green/Gray) selling on Amazon for $6.99 works. So after countless hours of wasted effort, my friend has a card formatted to Fat32 that works with a SanDisk mp3 player.Once again, SanDisk has admitted that these cards are not compatible with Androd 4.0 or above, that being 100% of Android tablets and a majority of Android phones. These cards are intentionally crippled by design.To quote a friend:""Per the SDHC standard, the format is FAT32. SDXC (64 GB and larger) the spec calls for exFAT. Microsoft has limited the OS to only format larger cards as exFAT and will not allow FAT32. Also, seems they have found a way to also block NTFS. Thus far, very few Android devices can read exFAT because they refuse to pay M$ for licensing of the exFAT file system. ""To all masochists out there--buy this card. To everyone else--unsafe at any speed.",1,Negatif

"I do not know if the GS3's have issues with reading cards of this size but I eventually had to remove this card and purchase a Transcend 8GB Class 10 card just to check if it was my phone that was the problem. When I got it I opened the packet, and popped it right in. Recognized, was able to start using, taking shots and video and they immediately saved to the card without the hangup my old class 2 card used to have. After a couple of days I noticed that I would take a shot and the phone would give me an error that it could not save to the SD card. You would have to reboot to fix. When scrolling through the gallery on the SD card it would freeze and the app would crash. I moved what I could, formatted the card but the same thing kept happening.Since installing the new Transcend 8GB card I've had no such issues. Maybe its just MY phone but I think there have been enough complaints from GS3 owners to be a little skeptical about this card on their phones.",3,Negatif

I need to clarify that the card is very slow when UHS-1 is not enabled. The read/write speeds drop to 13.3/7.9 MB/s. For devices that are a few years old such as Canon T2i which does not support UHS, 1080P recording may not be reliable.

While there might be a small speed boost in booting up and having the tablet ready to run compared to a Class 6 or a lower class card.  I would say it there just isn't that huge of difference between this and lower speed cards.  I would say it's what inside the tablet that will determine it's boot-up speed more than the card you put into it.
